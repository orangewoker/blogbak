门头设计以原始结构为基础，绿色框架开放式布局，选用大面积落地窗组合而成，最大限度的将光线与视野引入室内，轻盈的外立面充分呈现出健康、年轻、随性的表达。户外摆放着休闲椅，热闹街道的人来人往，吹着湖边清凉的微风，自觉代入露营风的舒适与自在。将茂盛的自然植被引入室内，与湖边四季遥相呼应，在此，享受时光的流转，细品生活的惬意。

The design of the door is based on the original structure, with an open layout of the green frame and a combination of large French windows to introduce light and vision into the room to the maximum extent, and the light facade fully presents a healthy, young, and casual expression. Leisure chairs are placed outdoors, and people come and go in busy streets, blowing the cool breeze by the lake and consciously substituting the comfort and freedom of camping wind. Lush natural vegetation is introduced indoors, echoing the four seasons by the lake. Here, you can enjoy the flow of time and the comfort of a fine life.

结合混凝土、环保木材的使用，让空间的自然氛围感得到了充分表达。玻璃砖设计，将直射自然光线液化柔和，模糊室内外的界限。绿色旋转楼梯静静矗立，在光影间更显明亮与轻松氛围，将人们引入楼上一探究竟。

Combined with concrete and environmentally friendly wood, the natural atmosphere of the space has been fully expressed. Glass brick design makes direct natural light liquefied and soft, blurring the boundary between indoors and outdoors. The green spiral staircase stands quietly, creating a brighter and more relaxed atmosphere between the light and shadow, leading people upstairs to explore.

在空间结构上呈现了开放性，混凝土水泥平铺空间底色，原木色和绿色增添空间自然质感，通过不同材质、不同粗细的肌理呈现视觉层次。保留了原始的承重结构，水泥裸柱呈现自然之美，自由流畅的动线布局，同时保持了人与人、桌与桌之间有效的舒适距离。无论在室内任何位置，都能享受健康美食与轻松社交。

The spatial structure presents openness, with concrete and cement paving as the base colour of the space, and the natural texture of the space is enhanced by the colour of logs and green. The visual hierarchy is presented through different materials and textures of different thicknesses. The original load-bearing structure is retained, and the bare cement column presents natural beauty, free and smooth moving line layout, while maintaining an effective and comfortable distance between people and tables. You can enjoy healthy food and cosy social interaction no matter where you are indoors.

卸下疲惫的舒适场域，轻抿一口香醇咖啡，品尝口齿留香的牛排和沙拉… 好友打卡，团建聚餐，情侣约会都可以来这里。柔和的光影衍生至每个角落，隐藏灯带点缀，照映出墙面天然的肌理，无不展现自然原始的魅力。

This is a cosy place where you can take off the tired, take a sip of fragrant coffee, and taste the steaks and salads with a lingering fragrance. Friends can check in or have a group dinner, and couples can come here for dates. Soft light and shadow are derived to every corner, and hidden lights are used as embellishments to reflect the natural texture of the wall, showing the original charm of nature.

二层刻意留出户外露台空间，更好的让室内外相结合，城市的街景一览无余，绿意盎然相映成趣。一顿简餐一杯果汁，沉浸在浪漫的 brunch，宁谧舒服的小角落。

On the second floor, outdoor terrace space is deliberately set aside to combine indoor and outdoor activities better. The street view of the city is unobstructed and full of green sets each other off. A portion of light food with a glass of juice, immersed in the romantic brunch in the quiet and comfortable little corner.
